{{!-- How to write for the page (bound into lesson-guide.md as `editor`).
      The ground truth is the student's frame: packages/player/src/lib/
      frame-document.ts (math, the policy) and the runtime's stylesheet
      (scripts/runtime-build.ts). Figures are SVG since 1 October (Javi:
      "do svg figures"). --}}
How to write for the page, which is a browser's own, in a frame of its own:

- **Text** is plain HTML: `<p>`, `<h2>` and `<h3>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`,
  `<table>`, `<blockquote>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<code>`, `<a>`. The page
  dresses it in the site's look, light and dark: style none of it.
- **Math** is `$…$` in the text, and `$$…$$` displayed, drawn with KaTeX:
  `aligned`, `pmatrix` and `cases` work; no theorem environments, `\label`
  or `\ref`. Never inside `<code>`, which shows it as written.
- **Figures** are SVG, inline: one `<svg>` with a `viewBox` and no width or
  height, `role="img"` and an `aria-label` saying what it shows, labels as
  `<text>`. Lines and labels in `currentColor`, the page's ink, and
  `var(--accent)` for the one thing the figure is about; a color only for
  what it means in the subject (`var(--success)`, `var(--danger)`,
  `var(--ink-muted)`). Leave shapes unfilled, or tint them with
  `fill-opacity="0.15"`; never a white or pale fill, which hides a label in
  the dark.
- **Pictures** cannot be drawn: ask the teacher for one and place it with
  `<img src="address" alt="what it shows">`.
- **Scripts** are inline, or from `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/`; the page reaches
  no network, posts no form, and keeps nothing between visits. What you
  draw yourself takes the page's colors as above, and nothing moves by
  itself for a student who asked for less motion
  (`prefers-reduced-motion`).
